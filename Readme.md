# Software Requirements Specification

## Introduction
The objective is to develop a web application for efficient event management and streamlined event discovery for end-users. The application will leverage the MERN stack to provide a robust and user-friendly experience.

## System Architecture

### Web Stack
- **MERN Stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, Node.js):**
  - **MongoDB:** A NoSQL database that ensures scalability and flexibility for storing event-related data such as event details, user profiles, and authentication tokens.
  - **Express.js:** A lightweight web application framework for building APIs to handle business logic and manage requests efficiently.
  - **React.js:** A robust front-end library for building dynamic, responsive user interfaces that enhance the user experience.
  - **Node.js:** A JavaScript runtime environment for building scalable back-end services.

### Deployment Strategy
- **Cloud Platform:** The application will be deployed on **Vercel** for its simplicity and seamless integration with the React.js front-end.
- **Front-End Framework:** React.js will be used to build the front end for its flexibility and component-based architecture, which enhances maintainability and scalability.
- **Styling Tools:** Bootstrap for styling the web application due to its simplicity, widespread use, and pre-designed components that speed up development while ensuring a consistent look and feel.

### Motivation
- **MERN Stack:** Provides a unified development experience using JavaScript across the stack.
- **React.js:** Simplifies front-end development with reusable components and excellent ecosystem support.
- **Bootstrap:** Speeds up the styling process with pre-designed components, ensuring a modern look and responsive design.
- **Vercel Deployment:** Guarantees fast, reliable, and globally distributed hosting with minimal configuration.

## System Requirements Specification

### How the Application Will Work
1. **End-Users:**
   - Browse and search for upcoming events through a responsive interface.
   - Register and log in to access personalized features such as saved events.

2. **Administrators:**
   - Manage event operations such as adding, editing, and canceling events.
   - Securely log in to access administrative tools.

### Target Audience
- **End-Users:** Individuals looking to discover events.
- **Admins:** Authorized personnel managing event-related information.

### Benefits
- **For End-Users:**
  - Quick access to relevant events.
  - Personalized event suggestions.

- **For Administrators:**
  - Simplified event management through an intuitive dashboard.
  - Improved efficiency in updating and maintaining event details.

### User Stories
1. **End-User:**
   - *As an end-user, I want to search for events by category, so I can quickly find events of interest.*
   - *As an end-user, I want to view event details, so I can make informed decisions about attending.*

2. **Administrator:**
   - *As an admin, I want to add new events, so users can discover the latest activities.*
   - *As an admin, I want to update event details, so users have accurate information.*
   - *As an admin, I want to cancel events, so users are informed about changes.*

### Comparison with Existing Software
- **Similar Software:** Eventbrite, Meetup
- **Advantages:**
  - Simpler interface for users with fewer distractions.
  - Cost-effective solution for small to medium-sized conference centers.
  - Focused on streamlined event management rather than additional social features.

### Functional Requirements
- **Guest Users:**
  - Ability to register through Sign-Up.
  - Access their accounts via Login.

- **End-Users:**
  - View a comprehensive list of upcoming events.
  - Search for specific events based on criteria such as date, category, or location.

- **Administrators:**
  - Add new events to the platform.
  - Update event details, such as time, location, and description.
  - Cancel or delete events as needed.

### Non-Functional Requirements
- **Responsive Design:** Seamless user experience on both desktop and mobile devices.
- **Secure Authentication:** Robust security protocols for admin accounts, including multi-factor authentication.
- **User-Friendly Interface:** Intuitive navigation and design for all user roles.
- **Scalability:** The system should handle an increasing number of users and events efficiently.
- **Performance:** Pages should load within 2 seconds for optimal user experience.
